## About
This project looks into NYC's micro mobility market with Citi Bike's ride sharing service. The data is from [Citi Bike Trip Data](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data).<br>
The data was initially loaded onto Jupyter notebook for exploration and cleaning.<br> 
I noticed a lot of bike trips that were logged were under 5mins or over 24hrs - most likely due to a broken bike or someone forgetting to end their ride.<br> 
I considered these to be insignificant data points and excluded them from the dataset.<br> 
The cleaned dataset was then loaded onto Tableau for additional exploration and visualizations.<br> 
The finished product is a interactive dashboard highlighting key aspects to help publicize and improve the bike sharing program.<br> 
The storyboard is additional content to help further understand the datasets discoveries.<br>
